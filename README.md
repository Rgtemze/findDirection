# findDirection

## Aim
This project is aimed to find the which way person is heading to by using Google Maps JavaScript API and HTML 5 Geolocation
## Test
This projest is tested by Google Chrome Dev Options using Geolocation Sensor and in the near future real-device test will be conducted
## Technologies Used
* *Google Maps JavaScript API* is used for the sake of visualization and test.
* *HTML 5 Geolocation* is used to get the location of user
## Drawbacks
On devices where GPS feature is not included such as desktop computers *HTML 5 Geolocation* will only rely on IP Address and try to find the location based on it. This may decrease the accuracy. Thus, this project will best work if used with GPS-included devices such as iPhone and Android device.
